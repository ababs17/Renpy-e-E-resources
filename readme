Project Details – The Space Excursion
What does it do / How does it work?
The Space Excursion is a digital children’s story designed as a visual novel that teaches kids about space weather. how solar activity from the Sun impacts life and technology on Earth. The story follows a group of curious students and their teacher, Miss Maisie, on a class field trip to the Sun. Along the way, they meet Astronaut Sena Azor aboard a space station, who explains how various Sun phenomena impact astronauts, pilots, farmers, power grids, and generally people on Earth.
This project combines storytelling, science education, and interactive visuals. Users read through dialogue, click to advance scenes, and experience space weather concepts through storytelling rather than lectures.

What are the actual benefits?
Educational: Simplifies complex space science for children through story and character interaction.


Interactive: Uses humor, curiosity, and colorful animation to maintain attention.


Accessible: Browser-based and easy to use by schools, teachers, and families.


Inspirational: Encourages kids to explore science, space, and engineering careers by showing relatable heroes (like Ghanaian astronaut Sena Azor).



What is the intended impact of the project?
The goal is to make heliophysics relatable for young learners. By turning scientific facts into an emotional and visual experience, The Space Excursion helps children understand how the Sun connects to everyday life. It aims to:
Build awareness of space weather’s impact on technology and people.


Inspire curiosity in STEM fields, especially astronomy and space science.


Highlight diversity and global teamwork in space exploration.



What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use?
Our team used:
Ren’Py – to develop and code the visual novel (Python-based engine).


Photoshop – to design and refine character art, backgrounds, and scenes.


Perplex (AI tool) – to assist in generating and styling CSS elements for the interface.


Word & PDF editors – for scripting, editing, and screenplay formatting.


The visual novel was then built, tested, and exported in HTML5, making it playable directly in browsers.


This project contains resources for  Ren'Py visual novel game. It provides images, GUI assets, scripts, and translations required for the game to function.

## Project Structure
- `gui.rpy`, `options.rpy`, `screens.rpy`, `script.rpy`: Ren'Py script files defining game logic, GUI, options, and screens.
- `gui/`: Contains GUI assets (buttons, overlays, bars, sliders, etc.) used for the game's interface.
- `images/`: Backgrounds and character sprites for scenes and interactions.
- `cache/`: Compiled bytecode and analysis files generated by Ren'Py for faster loading.
- `libs/`: Additional libraries or resource lists.
- `tl/`: Translation files for localization.

## How It Works
1. **Ren'Py Engine**: The `.rpy` files are loaded by the Ren'Py engine, which interprets the script and manages game flow.
2. **Assets Usage**: Images and GUI elements are referenced in the scripts to display backgrounds, characters, and interface components.
3. **Translations**: The `tl/` folder allows for localization, enabling the game to support multiple languages.
4. **Cache**: The `cache/` directory stores compiled files to optimize game startup and performance.

## Details
- Scripts are written in Ren'Py's Python-based scripting language.
- GUI customization is achieved by editing assets in the `gui/` folder and referencing them in script files.
- Adding new images or GUI elements requires placing them in the appropriate folder and updating the script to use them.
- Translations are managed by adding new language folders under `tl/` and providing `.rpym` files for each language.

## Getting Started
1. Install Ren'Py from [renpy.org](https://www.renpy.org/).
2. Place this project folder inside Ren'Py's projects directory.
3. Launch Ren'Py and select this project to run or edit.
